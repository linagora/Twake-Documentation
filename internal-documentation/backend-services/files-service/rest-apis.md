- **GET /companies/:company_id/files/:file_id/download** Download a file



### Classic upload 

To upload a single file, you must call this route and put the file binary data into a "file" multipart section.

- **POST /companies/:company_id/files** Upload a file. → This route is call to upload a file when chunk upload is not necessary

    ```javascript
    Response:
    {
        "resource": {
            "company_id": "",
            "id": "uuidA"
        }
    }


### Upload with chunk

To upload a file in multiple chunk you must first initial the file itself, and then upload into the file.

The file initialisation and following upload calls takes this parameters as **a query string**:

- **filename**: string, file name
- **type**: string, mime type for the file
- **totalChunks**: number, total number of chunk to be uploaded
- **totalSize**: number, sum of every chunk size (total file size)
- **chunkNumber**: number, current chunk uploaded, set it to undefined during file creation process.

- **POST /companies/:company_id/files/?filename...** Upload a file. → This route should first be called without data to initialise the entity for multi-chunk, then chunks must be sent on other route below.

    ```javascript
    Response:
    {
        "resource": {
            "company_id": "",
            "id": "uuidA"
        }
    }

    ```

- **POST /companies/:company_id/files/:file_id/?totalChunks...** Overwrite a file to a company as a user (check user belongs to company) → User can call this if file was not already uploaded → If file already exists only **apps** can do this (users cannot directly overwrite a file)

    ```javascript
    Response:
    {
        "resource": {
            "company_id": "",
            "id": "uuidA"
        }
    }

    ```
